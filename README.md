# 👋 Hey, I’m Precious Ojogu ([aka @_Ojogu](https://x.com/_Ojogu))

I'm a software engineer with a builder’s mindset and a systems approach to problem-solving. From backend APIs to intelligent agents, from academic analyzers to fintech platforms — I design and ship solutions that are fast, functional, and user-centered.

Currently a Computer Science student at the University of Calabar, I spend my time experimenting with automation, designing scalable systems, and using AI where it makes sense.

## 🧠 What I'm Into

🛠 **Backend Engineering** – RESTful APIs, background workers, scalable architecture, and clean abstractions.

🤖 **Intelligent Systems** – NLP agents, automation, vector search, and context-aware workflows.

📊 **Data & Analytics** – From academic result simulations to financial summaries, I enjoy turning raw data into clarity.

💰 **Fintech & Tools** – Building tools like **EgoSmart**, a smart finance assistant for WhatsApp users, and integrating real-time banking APIs.

🎓 **EdTech Experiments** – Created **AcadGrade**, a tool that helps students simulate results, analyze weaknesses, and OCR transcript data for planning.

🧪 **Tinkering & Systems Thinking** – Always thinking about design trade-offs, infrastructure flow, and what makes a system reliable in the real world.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

**Languages:**  
Python (go-to), SQL, Golang

**Frameworks & Tools:**  
Flask-RESTful, FastAPI, Celery, LangChain, CrewAI, ADK, Google GenAI

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure – Background jobs, queues, async processing, rate-limiting  
🧠 Better AI Agents – Planning/reasoning hybrids, tool usage, long-term context  
🔐 Automations and Bots  
📐 System Design – Planning like an engineer, not just a coder
